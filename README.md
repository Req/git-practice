## Branch

A branch in Git is a separate line of development that allows you to work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase until you're ready to merge your changes.

## Pull request

A pull request in Git is a request to merge changes from one branch (or fork) into another, often used for collaboration and code review.

## Fork in GitHub

A fork in GitHub is a personal copy of someone else's repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
