## Branch

- it is a copy of the main version, where it is possible to make some changes, before it will influence the main version. So we can test something and see if it works or not.


## Pull request

- it is the stage where the changes at our branch need to be reviewed before merging.



## Fork in GitHub

- it is our personal copy of some repo. It is independent one. We can use it to give some advise to the repo to owner or just do some experiments. It is possible even we don't have "only read" access. I think it is very close to how does branch work, but we don't need to be collaborators.
